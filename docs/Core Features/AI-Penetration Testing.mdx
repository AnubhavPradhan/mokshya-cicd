Mokshya AI automates penetration testing directly from your browser, helping identify vulnerabilities before attackers do.  

### What It Does
- Simulates real-world attacks like **SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), CSRF**, etc.  
- Uses AI agents to determine attack paths and severity levels intelligently.  
- Generates vulnerability reports with:  
  - CVSS-based risk scoring  
  - Screenshots or reproduction steps  
  - Business context and remediation steps  
- Supports **scheduled testing** or **event-triggered scans**  

### How It Works
1. Select the **Scan Website** mode.  
2. Enter the target domain or URL.  
3. The AI runs automated penetration checks, simulating attacker behavior.

### Results Include
- Vulnerability list (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, misconfigurations)  
- Risk ratings based on severity and potential business impact  
- Remediation guidance with actionable steps  
- Ability to ask follow-up questions or request a **PDF/doc report** for auditors or developers
