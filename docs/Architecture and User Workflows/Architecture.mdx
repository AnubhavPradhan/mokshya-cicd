Mokshya AI follows a **modular architecture** designed for scalability, security, and ease of use. Every layer works together to provide an end-to-end AI-powered security experience.  

### 1. User Layer
- **Browser Access**: Users interact with Mokshya AI directly from their browser, eliminating complex installation.  
- **Authentication**: Secure login via Google OAuth ensures sessions are encrypted and account data is protected.  

### 2. Frontend (NuxtJS)
- Provides the main user interface including login, dashboard, chat, and mode selection.  
- Offers real-time interactions such as entering scan requests, selecting compliance policies, and reviewing reports.  
- Designed for **cross-device use**, meaning users can access their data from any environment.  

### 3. Backend (API Server)
- Acts as the central hub for authentication, orchestration, and usage tracking.  
- Manages rate limits, user quotas, and subscription enforcement.  
- Ensures requests are validated and securely passed on to the AI Manager.  

### 4. AI Manager
- Routes incoming requests to the most suitable AI agent.  
- Manages task execution flow and tracks dependencies (e.g., recon before vulnerability testing).  
- Optimizes performance by batching or prioritizing tasks.  

### 5. AI Agents
Specialized modules designed for distinct security functions:  
- **Pentest Agent**: Runs automated penetration testing and recon.  
- **Code Analysis Agent**: Reviews repositories and detects vulnerabilities.  
- **Research/Q&A Agent**: Provides cybersecurity knowledge and remediation suggestions.  

Agents interact with both **LLMs** and **external security tools**.  

### 6. Intelligence Layer
- **LLM Engine**: OpenAI-based foundation that processes natural language queries and agent outputs.  
- Provides reasoning, report formatting, and compliance alignment for generated outputs.  

### 7. Data & Storage
- **MongoDB** stores:  
  - Conversations (chat history, prompts, responses)  
  - Reports (pentest results, code scan results)  
  - User metadata (plan usage, preferences)  
- Data is stored securely with **access control** and **encrypted transport**.  

### 8. Output & Integrations
- **Export Service**: Converts results into auditor-ready formats.  
- **Enterprise Integrations**: Webhooks and APIs connect to:  
  - CI/CD Pipelines for continuous checks  
  - Ticketing systems for issue tracking  
  - SIEM tools for centralized monitoring and alerts
