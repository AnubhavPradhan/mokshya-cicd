## 1. Login Issues
**Problem**: Unable to log in with Google OAuth.  

### Possible Causes
- Browser blocking cookies or pop-ups  
- Using an unsupported browser or outdated version  
- Google account not linked correctly with Mokshya AI  
- Temporary service outage  

### Steps to Fix
1. Make sure you are using a supported browser (**Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari**).  
2. Enable third-party cookies and pop-ups in your browser settings.  
3. Clear your browser cache and cookies, then try logging in again.  
4. Ensure your Google account is active and not restricted by organization policies.  
5. Try logging in from a private/incognito window.  
6. If login still fails, check Mokshya AI’s **status page** (if provided) for outages.  
7. Contact support if none of the above works.

## 2. Scan Not Starting
**Problem**: When entering a website URL or code snippet, the scan does not begin.  

### Possible Causes
- Not logged in or session expired  
- Reached message limit for current plan  
- Invalid input format (e.g., incorrect URL)  
- Temporary backend service delay  

### Steps to Fix
1. Confirm that you are signed in (check the profile avatar in the top-right corner).  
2. Check your remaining messages in the profile menu.  
3. If the limit is reached, **upgrade your plan** to unlock more scans.  
4. Use a valid URL starting with `http://` or `https://`.  
5. For code, paste a clean snippet or upload a valid file.  
6. Refresh the browser and retry.  
7. If the scan still doesn’t start, wait a few minutes and try again.

## 3. Results Not Loading
**Problem**: A scan runs but no output is displayed in the chat panel.  

### Possible Causes
- Browser caching issue  
- Session timeout  
- Results generated but not rendered in the frontend  
- Internet connectivity disruption  

### Steps to Fix
1. Refresh the page to reload the dashboard.  
2. Go to **My Conversations** in the profile menu and check if the results are stored.  
3. If results are missing, rerun the scan with the same input.  
4. Test your internet connection to ensure stability.  
5. If the issue persists, try a different browser or device to rule out local issues.

## 4. Export Issues
**Problem**: Reports cannot be downloaded in Markdown or PDF format.  

### Possible Causes
- Browser blocking file downloads  
- Export service temporarily unavailable  
- Incomplete scan (no report generated yet)  

### Steps to Fix
1. Make sure your browser allows file downloads (check security settings).  
2. Ensure the scan or policy was completed before attempting export.  
3. Retry export in another supported browser (**Chrome/Firefox recommended**).  
4. If downloading still fails, open **My Conversations** and try exporting from there.  
5. Contact support if export repeatedly fails across multiple sessions.
